Flask-Fumble:
🚀 Welcome to my Flask playground! This is where I test, stumble, and learn. Mistakes will be made, lessons will be learned, and hopefully, something cool will come out of it.

About:
"Flask Rookie Moves: From Scratch" pretty much sums it up. If you're new to Flask and figuring things out like me, Expect basic API setups, login systems, and a lot of trial and error.

What to Expect
✔️ First steps with Flask
✔️ Authentication & session handling
✔️ Routing and templates
✔️ Probably some bugs 🤷

Disclaimer

This is not a pro-level tutorial it's a learning journey. This project is totally casual, just me experimenting with Flask for fun and seeing where it goes. No grand ambitions, no pressure—just pure curiosity. Feel free to open issues or suggest improvements!
